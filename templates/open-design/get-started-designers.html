                Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned designer, you have unique skills that can be helpful to share. Think technical skills, like proficiency with specific tools, as well as soft skills like great interviewing technique! Projects often share the type of skills they are looking for in their requests.

                It's important to understand how much time you can dedicate to a project to avoid getting overwhelmed or frustrated. Projects can require one offs contributions or demand long term involvement. There are paid contributions and pro-bono ones as well, so make sure to look for the details. Ask yourself what you feel comfortable with!

                New tools can be daunting, and projects may have specific processes. GitHub is a key tool in the open source community. While not all projects require it, being familiar with GitHub is definitely advantageous!

                There are thousands of open source projects out there. It can be hard to find the one to contribute to, so many projects published on GitHub use tags like "good first issue" or specific requests like "UX testing needed". You can also consult job boards, like the one on the Open Design website. You don't have to be familiar with the project itself to be a valuable contributor, so don't be afraid to reach out to the maintainers if you feel like you have something to share!

                Spend some time familiarising yourself with the product or project and brand guidelines to ace your contribution. Think about what colours/fonts and tone of voice are preferred. Check out design systems, accessibility guidelines and past user research for context. And don't forget to check their code of conduct if they have one!

                Most contributions require specific deliverables, so make sure you understand what is asked, look into specification documentss or moodboards if provided. A lot of projects also have public roadmaps, check it out to find out what you can get involved with.

                Contributing to projects can be rewarding and exciting, but also chaotic and time-consuming. Most projects are maintained by passionate volunteers, and it might take time to get feedback. Validation processes can also be lengthy and your submission might not make it to the final product. Regardless, the experience you will gain from participating is a positive in and off itself.

                Do not feel pressured to give more than you are comfortable with. Keep in mind that your time and expertise is valuable, and should not be exploited without you getting something in return, be it material for your portfolio or the satisfaction of doing something good for your community.

              <p>
                You will likely have to educate other people on the value of design, and that's ok! Don't hesitate to ask for what you need.

                Understanding licensing is important when working on open source projects. There are different types of licenses commonly used, like GPL or MIT. It's important to check which one the project is using!

                Many open-source projects welcome volunteer contributions, while some offer compensation or grants for specific design tasks. It all depends on the project's funding and goals, so there are opportunities for everyone to get involved and make a difference!
